|**Sl. No.**|**Course Objectives**|
| :-: | :-: |
|1|Introduction to different commands commonly used in networking.|
|2|Provide hands on experience related to error detection, routing and congestion control algorithms.|
|3|Simulate the working of different networks using simulation software. [NS2/ NS3] |


|**Weeks**|**List of Programs**|
| :-: | :-: |
|**PART-A: Implement the following using C++/Java/Python**|
|1|Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.|
|2|Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).|
|3|Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.|
|4|Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present|
|5|Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.|
|6|Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.|
|7|Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm.|
|8|Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.|
|**PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other suitable simulation software**|
|<p></p><p>9</p>|Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.|
|<p></p><p>10</p>|Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion|
|11|Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.|
|<p></p><p>12</p>|Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets|
|13|**Lab Test/Event**|
